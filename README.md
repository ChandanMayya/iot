PART A

1.Run some python programs on Pi like: 
Read your name and print Hello message with name
Read two numbers and print their sum, difference, product and division.
Word and character count of a given string Area of a given shape (rectangle, triangle and circle) reading shape and appropriate values from standard input 
Print a name ‘n’ times, where name and n are read from standard input, using for and while loops. 
Handle Divided by Zero Exception. 
Printcurrent time for 10 times with an interval of 10 seconds.
Read a file line by line and print the word count of each line.

2.Get input from two switches and switch on corresponding LEDs

3.Flash an LED at a given on time and off time cycle, where the two times are taken from a file.

4.Switch on a relay at a given time using cron, where the relay’s contact terminals are connected to a load.

5.Access an image through a Pi web cam

6.Control a light source using web page.

7.Implement an intruder system that sends an alert to the given email.

8.Get the status of a bulb at a remote place (on the LAN) through web.

9.Get an alarm from a remote area (through LAN) if smoke is detected.
The student should have hands on experience in using various sensors like temperature, humidity, smoke, light, etc. and should be able to use control web camera, network, and relays connected to the Pi.


PART B

1. A team of two students must develop the mini project. However during the examination, each student must demonstrate the project individually.

2. The team must submit a brief project report (20-25 pages) that must include the following
a. Introduction 
b. Requirement Analysis 
c Software Requirement Specification
d. Analysis and Design
e. Implementation 
f. Testing

3. Brief synopsis not more than two pages to be submitted by the team as per the format given. It is recommended that students to do prior art search as part of literature
survey before submitting the synopsis for the Mini/Major projects.

4. Rubrics may be used to evaluate the Mini-Project


Each students has to execute one program picked from Part-A during the semester end
examination. In SEE Part-A and Part-B shall be given 50% weightage each.
